        <h2>My Favourite Hobby<br><span id="hobby">playing Badminton</span></h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Badminton is my favourite game, which I like to play when I am free. Playing Indoor games like Badminton helps me to be fit and healthy. Playing Games Indoor also helps us to maintain stamina. As Badminton is played as 1v1 or 2v2, The competition is really high because the players need to focus on the shuttle and need to chase it. I like to play along with my friends. I enjoy a lot when I play with my friends becase when we compete with someone it helps us to improve our skills.I stay in a community, so there are many children here to play together. Sometimes we do play other game with everyone. We have lot of fun playing together.</p>
